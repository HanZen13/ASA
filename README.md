# [Sholl Analysis](http://fiji.sc/Sholl_Analysis)

A plugin for ImageJ, the standard in scientific image processing, that performs automated  Sholl directly from bitmap images. Sholl analysis [Sholl, D.A., 1953](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1244622/) is a historic method used by neuroanatomists to describe neuronal arbors.

The plugin takes the Sholl technique beyond conventional approaches, offering major advantages over other implementations:

  * It does not require previous tracing of the arbor
  * Uses curve fitting to retrieve robust metrics from sampled data
  * Performs "Continuous Sholl" in 2D and 3D
  * Analysis can be applied to previously traced arbors

Why _ASA_? Throughout 2012 the plugin was [temporarily](SHA: 1fdf4992b7) called _Advanced Sholl Analysis_, hence the acronym
